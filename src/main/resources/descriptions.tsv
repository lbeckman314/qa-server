Diagram_Reactions_With_Participant_Overlapping_Hub	Medium	Diagram reactions with a participant branch which overlaps the connection hub.
Diagram_Subpathway_Undiagrammed_Reactions		Human subpathways which do not have a diagram but are not embedded in the nearest ancestor pathway which has a diagram. The report lists the reactions which are not contained in the embedding diagram.
Diagram_Unsynchronized_Reactions		Diagrams with a drawn reaction out of synchronization with the one in the database.
Diagram_With_Unconnected_Entities	Blocker	Diagrams with entity nodes unconnected to any reaction.
Diagram_Wrong_Renderable_Class	Blocker	Pathway diagram renderables whose renderable class is inconsistent with the represented instance's schema class.
Disease_Entity_Inconsistent		Disesase Entity instances which are either empty or are not a disease reaction participant.

FailedReaction_Has_Output	Blocker	FailedReactions that have an output value.
InferredFrom_Used_In_Other_Attribute	High	"PhysicalEntities and Events whose inferredFrom value is also used as the value of another attribute, e.g. a human reaction has a mouse reaction as both its ""inferredFrom"" attribute and its ""precedingEvent"" attribute."
Instance_Duplication	High	Two different instances of the same class with the same values in their 'defining' attributes.
Instances_Without_StableIdentifier	Blocker	"StableIdentifier instances whose identifier is missing, unused, duplicated or referred to more than once."
Mandatory_Attributes	Blocker	Instances without a mandatory attribute value.
Multiple_Attributes_Cross_Classes_Missing_Simultaneously	High	"Instances missing values simultaneously in several specified attributes, both its own and through a reference, e.g. a ReactionlikeEvent missing inferredFrom, literatureReference and its Summation's literartureReference."
Multiple_Attributes_Missing_Simultaneously	High	"Instances missing values simultaneously in several of the instance's own specified attributes, e.g. a Person missing both firstname and initial."
New_Event_Inconsistent	High	"Previously unreleased Events missing both an inferredFrom and a literatureReference value (or new events missing editorial attributes, edited, reviewed, or authored)."
Normal_Entity_Inconsistent		Normal Entity instances which are either empty or are not a normal reaction participant.
One_Hop_Circular_Reference	Medium	"Instances with a cycle through one direct reference, i.e. instance A references another instance B which references A. Often, this is a Pathway A with a hasEvent instance B that specifies Pathway A as precedingEvent."
Orphan_Events	Blocker	Human non-chimeric events which are neither a top-level event nor contained by another event.
Pathway_Without_Diagram		Pathways without an associated diagram. A pathway is regarded as having an associated diagram if it has its own PathwayDiagram or its contained RLEs  are drawn in its ancestor pathway diagram.
PhysicalEntity_With_More_Than_One_Compartment	High	PhysicalEntities (other than sets) with more than one compartment specified.
PhysicalEntity_Without_Species_Components_With_Species	High	"PhysicalEntities (complex, set, polymer) with no species specified but with components having species specified."
